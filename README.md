# Memory Game Exercise

### Main information
<p>This is a repository for a memory game app.</p>

<p>The memory game is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

### Design

<p>The design of the memory game was inspired by the "Diablo" games franchise. As a long fan of the "Diablo" games, I thought that the memory game app would look cool and it would have an atmosphere.</p>

### Main Ideas & setbacks

<p>The main idea of the exercise was to practice JavaScript & CSS. 
Had several stumbling stones for this exercise. 
The first one was how to make the flip animations work smoothly with every card click. 
The second one was how to create the difficulty levels and set them accordingly with the corresponding button clicks, mainly after clicking the reset button.</p>
